# Problem Statement
# Prompt the user to enter the lengths of each side of a triangle and then calculate and print the 
# perimeter of the triangle (the sum of all of the side lengths).

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

# What is the length of side 1? 3

# What is the length of side 2? 4

# What is the length of side 3? 5.5

# The perimeter of the triangle is 12.5


# Solution


def main():
     """Program to calculate the perimeter of the triangle"""
     #Prompt the user to enter the length is each side of the triangle
     side1 = float(input("\033[1;3m What is the length of the side 1? \033[0m"))
     side2 = float(input("\033[1;3m What is the length of the side 2? \033[0m"))
     side3 = float(input("\033[1;3m What is the length of the side 3? \033[0m"))

     #calculate the perimeter 
     perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3

     #print the perimeter of the triangle
     print(f"The perimeter of the triangle is {perimeter}")
